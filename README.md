# Artify-
A Simple Personal Website

**Artify** is a personal website project made using **HTML and CSS**. It includes multiple pages like:

* A **homepage** with navigation links
* An **about page** with details about the creator or the purpose
* Possibly a **gallery** or section that shows pictures or artworks

This project was created for learning and showcasing how a basic website is structured using folders, images, links, and style sheets. The folder includes:

* `index.html` â€” the main homepage
* Other HTML pages (like `about.html`)
* A `style.css` file for the design and layout
* Image files used in the site
* All content organized to work together like a real website

You can edit or personalize this. Want me to make it sound more formal, more casual, or school project-style?
